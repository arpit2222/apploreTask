# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
i have recorded a demo video please first watch it.
Was facing some errors with multer and .env and wasted some time fixing them but was not able to.
Added dummy images, i think mukter causes problem in dev envirenmnet and don't have resources to check on prod so used dummy images.
Used harcoded endpoint because .env file was causeing probelm.

Was thinking of adding more features but was not able to add those in time. Most of the pages are responsive but some are not.
Was not able to handle all errors properly, want to submit on time.
